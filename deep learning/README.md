### Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)

* Mission: Write Keras code to implement the CNN model.
* Data set: [Fashion MNIST dataset](https://keras.io/api/datasets/fashion_mnist/)
  - Read the data set description. This is a dataset of 60, 000 28 × 28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, along with a test set of 10, 000 images.
* Approaches:
  - CNN model (required): Don’t use any built-in CNN architectures such VGG or ResNet. Please use keras library to build a simple CNN model: [Keras](https://keras.io/).
  - Other data pre-processing or feature engineering methods (optional): You can apply any technique you prefer.
* Performance metric: Successfully train the CNN model using the training data and provide the accuracy for the test data.
